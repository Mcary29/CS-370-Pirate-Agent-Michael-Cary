# CS 370: Reinforcement Learning Pirate Agent
Michael Cary  

## Project Overview  
This project was part of CS 370: Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science. I developed a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks in a treasure-hunt style environment. The goal of the agent was to learn how to navigate the environment efficiently, avoiding traps and collecting treasure through trial and error.  

The provided starter code included the game environment, state definitions, and basic framework for how the agent could interact with the world. My main contribution was designing and implementing the reinforcement learning model itself. I built the deep Q-learning agent, tuned hyperparameters, and updated the training loop to improve learning performance over time.  

This notebook demonstrates how reinforcement learning concepts can be applied to a practical problem and shows the process of experimenting, refining, and analyzing results to reach a working solution.

## Reflection  

### What work did I do on this project?  
I was given starter code for the pirate environment, which defined the rules of the game, states, and actions available to the agent. I created the reinforcement learning logic that allowed the agent to learn from experience. This included implementing a deep Q-learning model, adjusting parameters like the learning rate and exploration decay, and analyzing training outcomes. I also added code for running multiple experiments to evaluate performance.  

### How does this connect to the larger field of computer science?  
Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing systems that can learn, adapt, and make decisions. This project connects directly to that mission. Reinforcement learning and neural networks, which I applied here, are the same techniques used in industries like robotics, autonomous vehicles, and personalized healthcare. By working through this project, I gained experience with the iterative, data-driven approach that computer scientists use to make systems intelligent and useful in the real world.  

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?  
I’ve learned that the best way to approach a problem is to break it into smaller parts, experiment, and refine based on results. For this project, I didn’t just try one setup and hope it worked — I tested different learning rates, exploration strategies, and reward functions until I found an effective solution. This structured, analytical way of thinking is at the core of computer science and is how progress is made whether in AI, software engineering, or system design.  

### What are my ethical responsibilities?  
As a computer scientist, my ethical responsibilities extend to both the end user and the organization. In the context of AI, it’s not enough for a system to simply work — it has to be trustworthy, fair, and respectful of user rights. Reinforcement learning systems can sometimes produce unintended or harmful behaviors, so transparency, testing, and safeguards are critical. If I were deploying an AI system in the real world, I would need to ensure that data is secure, users are informed, and the system operates responsibly.
